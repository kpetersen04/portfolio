        After building a successful career in the higher education industry, I
        am now looking to transition into a role in technology. Working
        alongside the Learning and Development Team in my current position
        provided me with some exposure to programming, and I found that I had a
        personal interest to pursue it further. This led me to complete a
        software engineering bootcamp to learn the technical skills needed to
        start as a junior in the industry.
      </p>
      <p className="_bio-text text">
        I have established myself as a confident and capable professional and my
        proven problem solving, organisation and interpersonal skills will serve
        me well as I navigate my first role in the technology sector.
