          I'm Kirstin Petersen, a Junior Software Engineer.

        <p className="_bio-text text">
          After building a successful career in the higher education industry, I
          am now looking to transition into a role in technology. Working
          alongside the Learning and Development Team in my current position
          provided me with some exposure to programming, and I found that I had
          a personal interest to pursue it further. This led me to complete a
          software engineering bootcamp to learn the technical skills needed to
          start as a junior in the industry.
        </p>
        <p className="_bio-text text">
          I have established myself as a confident and capable professional and
          my proven problem solving, organisation and interpersonal skills will
          serve me well as I navigate my first role in the technology sector.
